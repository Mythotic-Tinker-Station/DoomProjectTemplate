## How to build the pk3?
Clone this repo to your machine and then run CompilePk3.bat

Automatic builds can be found at https://jenkins.csnxs.uk/job/Lexicon/

## Where can I play this?
This can be played and hosted on [The Sentinel's Playground](https://allfearthesentinel.net "The Sentinel's Playground") with builds that i release.

I would like to ask that you do not upload builds compiled by yourself to the service as I will be also uploading any builds that i deem to be released as alpha or beta etc there. I will actually tell sgt Nax on you if you do this.

You are however free to upload your own compiled build as a private wad.
